## Cooking Recipes

Everything from Hot Cocoa to Cod Chowder and Sushi await you in this kitchen! I recommend reading through the recipes yourself, so you can learn how to cook everything.
Some food items have special effects, such as a giving you Strength or Fire Resistance for a short time! Careful though! Although the alcoholic items are strong and have positive effects, they also come with some nasty side effects!
